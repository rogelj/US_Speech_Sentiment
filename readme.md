In this notebook we run a straightforward sentiment analysis algorithm over a sample of speeches given by the two major candidates of the 2016 US election, Hillary Clinton and Donald Trump.

The speeches were given in various locations in the US and the text has been left as sourced by Nick Root.

The Jupyter notebook uses Python 3.5.
